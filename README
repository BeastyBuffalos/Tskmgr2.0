	 Initial:
      At the start of the program, the program prompts to ask if the user would like to add a task or to see existing tasks.
   
        If whatever is entered contains "new" it will enter the creating task state.
        If whatever is entered contains "existing" it will dump the tasklist.
        If niether of those are found, it will exit, saying unrecognizable request.
   
   New Tasks:
      If taking a new task, The scanner will prompt for the new tasksname
      then prompt for its type
      then for its due date
      then for how many hours it will take
      and finally for difficulty
    
   Existing Tasks:
      if checking existing tasks, the console will prompt for whether the user would like to edit a task, or see more info about a task.
            info: if checking info, nothing happens at the moment.
            edit: if editing, it allows the chosen task to be edited... currently in development but we are as far as requesting and recognizing thet ask to edit.
